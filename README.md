If you have developed an application which has extensive client scripting. You would have come across situations where you would need certain application level details at different places of your application. 
For Instance, you would need the current user details like login id or name or department in many modules like employee profile page, employee management page or employee resignation page etc etc.. It is cumbersome every time you make a api call to get the those details or even a common javascript function call to get the employee entity and later extract the data out of it.
 the code that I have provided a wrapper around this functionality to fetch the details very easily as if they are the global property.
 
 For simplicity I have used cookies, please feel free to use any other mechanism or suggest any other improvements.
 
 
 Many other utilites have been added in the same path.
 
 Thanks.
